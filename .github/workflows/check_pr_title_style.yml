          # Commits spec, you can use these options to customize the parsing of the type, scope and

          # correspond to the parts listed in `headerPatternCorrespondence`.

          # special "[WIP]" prefix to indicate this state. This will avoid the
          # validation of the PR title and the pull request checks remain pending.
