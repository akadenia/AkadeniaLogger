# CDN and Asset Policy

## STRICT POLICY
All images and badges MUST be served from our CDN at `https://cdn.akadenia.com/images/`

## Logo Images
- Use: `https://cdn.akadenia.com/images/akadenia-webp/logo/horizontal-logo.svg`
- Do NOT modify or move logo images

## Badge Images
- Use: `https://cdn.akadenia.com/images/badges/` folder structure
- NO external services: Do not use badge.fury.io, img.shields.io, or other external image services

## Badge Structure
- npm version badges: `npm-version-{package-name}.svg`
- License badges: `license-mit.svg` (shared)
- TypeScript badges: `typescript.svg` (shared)
- All badges go in: `images/badges/` folder

## MDX Compatibility
- NO style attributes: MDX does not support style attributes, remove them from all HTML elements
- NO anchor tags: MDX has issues with `<a>` tags, avoid using them
- Use HTML img tags: Use `<img>` tags instead of markdown image syntax for badges to maintain proper sizing
